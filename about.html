                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Let’s start off with where I am from. Värnamo, 
                    a small town in the southern woods of Sweden 
                    in the middle of a region named Småland. 
                    I was not born there but I was raised there.
                    I was born 1,5 hours south of Värnamo in a town 
                    called Alvesta. 
                    I tattooed a lot of my friends before I actually 
                    started tattooing for real. And the tattoos were 
                    not always good or let’s say well made. But 
                    apparently good enough for a tattoo artist to 
                    encourage me to start drawing again and maybe 
                    become his apprentice. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main1">
                <h2>Why Tattooing</h2>
                <p>Tattooing was a transition between the art you 
                    can put away when you dont want to see it and 
                    the art that is more or less permanent. I got 
                    my first tattoo when i was really young. It's 
                    between my shoulders and has faded away a lot 
                    by now. I did it in a garage at this guys home. 
                    He was the one who told me i should get in to 
                    tattooing. He thought so because he saw my 
                    drawings i brought to his place. I was indecisive 
                    of which one i should do first. Today i have 
                    them all on my body. I started drawing again 
                    but not tattooing until my wife (girlfriend at 
                    the time) bought me a tattoo kit. That was the 
                    start of my tattoo career. I still do it because of 
                    the feeling i get when i tattoo. It's special. 
                    From thousands of years in different cultures 
                    to an underground movement. Mystic and beautiful. 
                    Even if it's all visible many times, the "ritual" 
                    is special.</p>
